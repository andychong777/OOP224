I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

    During this workshop we used things like inheritance, virtual funcitons, and
file handling in C++. It helped me understand the ability in creating modualar and
maintainable code. Some of the challeneges I faced during this workshop was I kept
getting an error when trying to complie. I realised I had forgotten to include the 
fstream directive, which is very importnat for file handling functions in cpp.
Another obstacle arose when I encountered an issue with the 'override' specifier 
in the HtmlText class. This turned out to be due to an incorrectly overridden function, 
teaching me the importance of matching function signatures precisely when overriding 
base class functions. One puzzling error I encountered was the 'illegal qualified 
name in member declaration.' This experience emphasized that using a qualified name 
in a member declaration is not allowed and reinforced the importance of adhering to 
the rules of the scope resolution operator.
