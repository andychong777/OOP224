I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

Learning the concept of inheritance, I was able to use the member variables and 
functions of the parent class depending on which types use. The class that gives 
inheritance is the parent class. And the child class is the inherited class.  We 
can call and use the functions from the parent class, but the parent cannot use 
from child class. To add on, when the instance of the derived class is terminated, 
the destructor of the derived class is called first, followed by the destructor of 
the base class. Also, I was able to overload the input and output and implemented 
them. Some trouble that I had while completing this workshop was in main line 87. 
Cargo of 3456 would put truck over capacity of 5432, if cargo is bulk then can add 
up to 5432 but if cargo is not bulk it cannot add. The sample output seems to treat 
it as bulk. Furthermore, the code will not allow a partial unload.
