I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

During this workshop I learned about using templates. Using templates has the advantage
of being able to use various types freely in functions and classes. On the other hand
when multiple types of classes are implemented as afunctions of a template, the
abstract base class would be implemented first, and then as different types of classes
which in turn gets implemented. 

search function template:
The search function template accepts a Collection and an array of templated objects. 
To work with this function, the Collection type must have support for the "==" operator 
so that we can check for a match between objects and the key. Additionally, the T 
type (array element type) must be comparable with the Key type using the "==" operator, 
which is necessary to compare the elements of the array with the key to find matches.

listArrayElements function template:
The listArrayElements function template prints the elements of an array. To work 
with this function, the T type must support the insertion operator '<<' so that 
we can print the elements using the cout object.
