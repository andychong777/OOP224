    I learned about modular programming and being able to divide work into a modular
and easy to read and maintain program by making different files for functions 
related to different tasks. As well as using header files. Furthermore I learned 
about the syntax of the c++ language like using namespaces to organize code into 
logical groups and prevent name colisions, and #include <iostream> to access the 
input/output library. The most difficult part of the assignment was strStr function 
as it took me a long time to understand how to implement the logic to return the 
address of the first occurrence of str2 in str1. Also debugging my code is always 
tedious and even the smallest mistakes can go unnoticed. I had to do extra research 
in order to help complete the DIY part of the lab as I feel as I still have a lot 
of struggles when it comes to being a great coder. I want to keep improving and 
get better to be able to do it with confidence.
