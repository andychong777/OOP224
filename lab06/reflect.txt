I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

I was able to learn how to copy an object during this workshop. First, there are 
two ways to copy an object. There is a way to copy using a constructor or by using 
the operator "=". In the process of copying, shallow and deep copies occur. However,
the disadvantage of shallow copying is that if a variable with dynamic memory is 
copied, a memory leak will occur later. This is because when copying, only pointers 
are copied, not values. So I used deep copy in this workshop.  I have learned how to 
read and write files. In this workshop, I did not just read and write files, but 
overloaded insertions and extraction operators. These operators were passed as a 
parameter to a function defined within the class of reading and writing the file 
and used to enter or read the values of the member variables. And it is better 
to make a habit of checking with is_open() to make sure that you read the file 
properly before reading the file. When I read the value in the file using getline(), 
I read it using string because the length is unknown. I need to convert the string 
to C-style using "c_str" because to enter the value to the character pointer 
variable later. To use these string functions, I must declare the string library.
