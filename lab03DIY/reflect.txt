I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

    The topics that I learned while completing this workshop include learning how
use and implement objects and using the helpful iostream member functions. Being
able to use the member functions fill, setf, unsetf, and width when creating the
table helped me format the chart as expected. Using the fill allowed me to fill up
and empty space that was needed. Next I learned how to use class and using public
and private class. Also I used the member functions as a method to change or modify/
The most difficulty I had while completing this workshop was formatting the chart
to correctly output when it was an Invalid Calorie list and a valid list. Also
implementing the xxxxx.... in the blank lines was tricky to figure out as well.
