I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

    During this workshop, I had the opportunity to work on various deliverables 
related to dynamic memory allocation and dynamic arrays and pointers in C++. I had
some trouble with understanding the new concepts fully and watched youtube videos
explaining this topic in order to fully understand. This helped me to grasp the 
concepts and apply them effectively in my code. An out parameter is used when a
function needs to return multiple values. It allows the function to modify the
value of the parameter and pass it back to the caller. In the code, the function
"read" recieves an out parameter in the form of the postalCode and Population
variables. In contrast, an "in parameter" is used when a function only needs to 
receive a value for processing and does not modify it. Looking at the code, the 
function "sort" is an example of a function that receives an in parameter.
