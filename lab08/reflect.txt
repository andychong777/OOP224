I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

This week I was able to take a deep dive on the topic on inheritance concepts 
and polymorphism of C++. I also incorporated the concepts of Inheritance and 
Base and Derived Class in this workshop. Inheritance is one of the most 
important properties of OOP and allows to define a class in terms of another 
class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application. Also, it 
provides reusability. Also we had to give access, like private, protected, and 
public. Private gives full access to bars, protected provides limited access to 
only the derived class, and lastly public had unlimited access. Some trouble that 
I had during the workshop was when I was writing the code to make the rectangle, 
I am not sure my code wouldâ€™ve worked when dealing with height if it was only 1 
or 2. Overall the workshop was pretty straight forward as taking concepts from 
previous workshops and implementing them into this workshop as well.
