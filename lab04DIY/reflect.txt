I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*/
During this workshop we continued to build upon the use of Dynamic Allocation/ 
memory and using it to allocate arrays as well as deallocating it afterwards. 
I also got use the constructor and deconstructions while working on the workshop. 
I also learned that once you make a constructor we must delete the memory before 
the constructor is destoyed. We also in the DIY part had to know which functions 
belong in public and which belong in the private. All functions that the code 
communicates outside would be used in public and variables with array or macros 
can be held in private. The biggest problem I faced while completing this lab 
was when formatting the chart and getting the code right for that. The other 
parts of the DIY was pretty smooth saling but debugging the problem that I had 
with the output took some time and I had to carefully go back and look for the 
small mistakes that could be the problem.
